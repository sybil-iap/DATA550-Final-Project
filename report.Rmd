# Introduction
## 1 About Data sets
This project uses the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) data set to **develop a predictive model for Alzheimer's disease (AD)**. 

The OASIS data set provides comprehensive MRI data for a diverse group of individuals aged 18 to 96. It includes two primary components: Cross-section MRI data and Longitudinal MRI data.Here, we use longitudinal data for our modeling.

**Longitudinal MRI Data in Nondemented and Demented Older Adults**: This set consists of a longitudinal collection of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96. Each subject was scanned on two or more visits, separated by at least one year for a total of 373 imaging sessions. For each subject, 3 or 4 individual T1-weighted MRI scans obtained in single scan sessions are included. The subjects are all right-handed and include both men and women. 72 of the subjects were characterized as nondemented throughout the study. 64 of the included subjects were characterized as demented at the time of their initial visits and remained so for subsequent scans, including 51 individuals with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease. Another 14 subjects were characterized as nondemented at the time of their initial visit and were subsequently characterized as demented at a later visit.

## 2 About Analysis Objectives
The project will build several machine learning models to predict dementia/Alzheimer’s disease and compare the performances of these models.
